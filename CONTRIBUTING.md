## PRs

PRs are welcome from everybody.

During development, [create a test environment](./docs/TESTING.md#test-environment) to avoid polluting your account with debug data.

If you make changes to `/api`, add tests to `/api/tests`. [How to run `/api/tests`.](./docs/TESTING.md#api-tests).

## Version Releases

Before any version bump, run the [full testing checklist](./docs/TESTING.md) to check for regressions.
